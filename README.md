# ðŸŒ¸ iris-knn-classifier
A simple machine learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their features. Built using scikit-learn, this project demonstrates the basics of data loading, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
Uses scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset

Implements KNN (k=3) classification

Splits dataset into training and testing sets

Evaluates accuracy

Makes predictions on sample data

Saves and loads model using joblib
